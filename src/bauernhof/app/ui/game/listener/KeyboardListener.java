/**
 * The KeyboardListener class is responsible for handling keyboard input in the game.
 * It listens for key events and responds accordingly, allowing players to interact with the game using the keyboard.
 * In this implementation, the spacebar (VK_SPACE) is used to trigger certain game actions, such as starting the game and executing a move.
 *
 * This class implements the KeyListener interface to listen for keyboard events.
 * When the spacebar is pressed, it checks the game's current state and performs the appropriate action based on the game's rules.
 * For example, if the game is in the initial round (round 0), pressing the spacebar will progress to the next round and initialize beginner cards for the players.
 * During the actual game rounds, pressing the spacebar will execute the move of the current player if the player is a HumanPlayer.
