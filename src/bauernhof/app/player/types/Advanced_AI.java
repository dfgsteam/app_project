 * This class represents the Advanced_AI. It extends from the AbstractGamePlayer, because it is a GamePlayer. 
 * The Implementation of the AIHeader is not full, because this AI calculates the best Moves using the TreeCreator Class to calculate a Tree Of Moves and the TreeSearcher Class to calculate best Move for the Advnaced_AI.
 * The mission of the following Advanced_AI is to play smart. It looks in the future for given Calculational Depth and tries to play the Move, which will give most Advantage for the Future:
 * - Looks what the Enemies can do
 * - Thinks in kind, that the enemies will play most score achieving moves
 * - Compares Points with the enemies
 * - Peeks the Move, which will bring the best score difference in the future ( for the Advanced_AI)
