/**
 * This class implements a MouseEventListener for adding cards in the game UI.
 * It is designed to be used with the UiGame class.
 * 
 * The CardAddListener class provides the following functionality:
 * - Listens for mouse click events on GElements (elements) in the game UI.
 * - When a valid move is allowed by the UiGame instance, it adds the clicked GElement as a GCard to the game.
 * - The clicked GElement is then scaled and passed to the UiGame instance for processing.
 * - It also handles mouse enter and mouse exit events to adjust the scale of the GElement for visual feedback.
