 * This class represents a Random_AI, which extends from AbstractGamePlayer, because it is a GamePlayer.
 * It implements the AIHeader interface, in order to follow the structure of an Artifical Intelligence, which is written in the interface.
 * The Random_AI has the role of a very bad player, who has no idea of the game it plays and makes random moves:
 * - Does not understand, how the board looks like
 * - Does not understand the moves
 * - Does not consider the players
 * - Can't determine, which move is good or bad
 * - Plays fortune game
